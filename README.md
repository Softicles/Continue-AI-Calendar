# AI Calendar

## Overview

AI Calendar is a smart assistant that can make scheduling easier and more effective by creating events based on input PDF documents. Furthurmore, you can also manage your Google Calendar via the website!

This project was originally my idea as a final project for the class **CS 2340 - Objects and Design** at **Georgia Tech** in **Spring 2025**. While the course project concluded at the end of the semester, I chose to independently continue developing it beyond the class. Currently, the project is in testing stage but it has been deployed to the domain [**aicalendar.art**](https://www.aicalendar.art/)

## Utilities for this project

- Web framework: **Django**
- AI Model: **ChatGPT 4o/4o-mini**
- Frontend: **HTML**
