# AI Calendar

## Overview

**AI Calendar** is a smart assistant that automatically **extracts events from PDF documents** and seamlessly imports them into **Google Calendar**. This project aims to streamline scheduling by using AI to detect dates, times, and descriptions from structured or semi-structured files like syllabi, itineraries, and event brochures.

## Origin

This project was originally my idea for the final project for the class **CS 2340 - Objects and Design (Spring 2025)** at **Georgia Tech**.

## Continued Development

While the course project concluded at the end of the semester, I chose to independently continue developing AI Calendar beyond the class.
